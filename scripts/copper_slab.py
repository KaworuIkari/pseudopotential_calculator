m = 5  # Number of atomic layers in the z-direction (height)
n = 3  # Number of atoms along the x and y directions (width)
L = 10  # Number of vacuum layers in the z-direction

# Optionally fix the bottom layers of the slab (if needed for simulation stability)
# Uncomment the following lines to fix the bottom layer

# Optionally save the slab to a file
